# Lessons learned

## 2026-08-16 — Prisma advisory locks and PostgreSQL `void`

- **Failure mode:** Prisma 7 `$queryRaw` cannot deserialize the `void` result returned by `pg_advisory_xact_lock`.
- **Detection signal:** Auth/course e2e failed in `BootstrapService` with `Failed to deserialize column of type 'void'`.
- **Prevention rule:** Use `$executeRaw` for PostgreSQL advisory-lock calls that intentionally return no result; reserve `$queryRaw` for row-producing queries.

## 2026-08-16 — URI versioning requires explicit controller metadata

- **Failure mode:** `defaultVersion: 'v1'` tagged routes as versioned but mapped controllers without an explicit version to `/api/...`, not `/api/v1/...`.
- **Detection signal:** Auth/course e2e requests to `/api/v1/*` returned 404 while startup logs showed `/api/*` mappings.
- **Prevention rule:** Set `version: '1'` in each versioned controller's `@Controller` options and keep neutral health routes explicitly marked.

## 2026-08-16 — Plain-HTTP test sessions

- **Failure mode:** Secure cookies were not retained by supertest agents over HTTP, so authenticated follow-up requests were treated as unauthenticated.
- **Detection signal:** Login returned 201, but subsequent guarded routes returned 403 because the session cookie was absent.
- **Prevention rule:** Default `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` to false only when `NODE_ENV=test`; production and explicitly configured environments remain secure by default.

## 2026-08-16 — Guard status semantics

- **Failure mode:** Returning `false` from `SessionGuard` made Nest emit 403 Forbidden for a missing session instead of the contract's 401 Unauthorized.
- **Detection signal:** Unauthenticated course requests returned 403 while the e2e contract expected 401.
- **Prevention rule:** Throw `UnauthorizedError` for missing or invalid session credentials; reserve `ForbiddenError` for authenticated callers lacking permission.
